The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## Introduction

The AsyncAPI Specification is a project used to describe and document message-driven APIs in a machine-readable format. Itâ€™s protocol-agnostic, so you can use it for APIs that work over any protocol (e.g., AMQP, MQTT, WebSockets, Kafka, STOMP, HTTP, Mercure, etc).

The AsyncAPI Specification defines a set of files required to describe such an API.
These files can then be used to create utilities, such as documentation, integration and/or testing tools.

The file(s) MUST describe the operations an [application](#definitionsApplication) accepts. For instance, consider the following AsyncAPI definition snippet:

```yaml
user/signedup:
  subscribe:
    $ref: "#/components/messages/userSignUp"
```

It means that the [application](#definitionsApplication) allows [consumers](#definitionsConsumer) to subscribe to the `user/signedup` [channel](#definitionsChannel) to receive userSignUp [messages](#definitionsMessage) produced by the application.

**The AsyncAPI specification does not assume any kind of software topology, architecture or pattern.** Therefore, a server MAY be a message broker, a web server or any other kind of computer program capable of sending and/or receiving data. However, AsyncAPI offers a mechanism called "bindings" that aims to help with more specific information about the protocol.

#### <a name="definitionsApplication"></a>Application
An application is any kind of computer program or a group of them. It MUST be a [producer](#definitionsProducer), a [consumer](#definitionsConsumer) or both. An application MAY be a microservice, IoT device (sensor), mainframe process, etc. An application MAY be written in any number of different programming languages as long as they support the selected [protocol](#definitionsProtocol). An application MUST also use a protocol supported by the server in order to connect and exchange [messages](#definitionsMessage). 

#### <a name="definitionsProducer"></a>Producer
A producer is a type of application, connected to a server, that is creating [messages](#definitionsMessage) and addressing them to [channels](#definitionsChannel). A producer MAY be publishing to multiple channels depending on the server, protocol, and use-case pattern.
